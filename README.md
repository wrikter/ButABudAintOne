Jmike's 99 bottles of beer test

This was just a trial project that I wrote because I'm trying to get fully back into the swing of things with writing
C++. And, I really like the http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net website for learning new languages. So, while I'm
not learning a new language, I am definitely revisiting and re-learning.
